# MACHINE LEARNING AND STATISTICS TASKS

## TASK 1

Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and
prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should
not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should
research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.

### RESEARCH

From the question above the task involved writing a program to get the square root of the number two without using any of the Python library functions such as math.sqrt. The math.sqrt function can be used to check the answer to the final solution.

To calculate the sqrt root of a number to a certain number of decimal places the function getcontext() can be used to set the value from defulat 28 decimal to the desired number of decimal places in this case 100

To get the square root of any number a common method is used to calculate or approximate is the Newton Rampson approximation. This uses a matimatical formula to approximate the square root of a number this formula is run many times or iterations to get the square root approximation.

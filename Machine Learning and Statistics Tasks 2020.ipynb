    "Newton’s method makes use of the idea to approximate the solutions of $f(x)=0$. By drawing a graph of $f$, we can estimate a root of $f(x)=0$. We can call this estimate ${x}_{0}$. We then draw the tangent line to $f$ at ${x}_{0}$. If ${f}^{\\prime }({x}_{0})\\ne 0$, this tangent line intersects the x-axis at some point $({x}_{1},0)$. Now let ${x}_{1}$ be the next approximation to the actual root. Typically, ${x}_{1}$ is closer than ${x}_{0}$ to an actual root. Next we draw the tangent line to $f$ at ${x}_{1}$. If ${f}^{\\prime }({x}_{1})\\ne 0$, this tangent line also intersects the x-axis, producing another approximation, ${x}_{2}$. We continue in this way, deriving a list of approximations: ${x}_{0},{x}_{1},{x}_{2}\\text{,…}$. Typically, the numbers ${x}_{0},{x}_{1},{x}_{2}\\text{,…}$ quickly approach an actual root $x*$, as shown in the following diagram. \n",

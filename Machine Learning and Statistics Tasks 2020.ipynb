    "## TASK 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and\n",
    "prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should\n",
    "not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should\n",
    "research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.\n",

    "### RESEARCH\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of a number $S$ is a number when multiplied by itself yields the number $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common methods to calculating the square root of a number are iterative, the principle involves two steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Find a suitable starting seed value or guess.\n",
    "* Refine this value using an iterative calculation until a criteria is met to terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial Seed Value Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial seed value must be a positive non-zero number, it should be between 1 and $S$ the number we are trying to find the square root off. There are many methods of estimating this number because the better the estimate the less iterations the algorithm will have to perform to find the square root.\n",
    "\n",
    "For estimating the seed value $x$ for approximating the square root of $ S = 2$ and the fact that the number $x$ should be 0 < $x$ < 2 then we will choose 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common of this type of methods is the Newton Rampson approximation. This uses a mathematical formula to approximate the square root of a number this formula is run many times or iterations to get the square root approximation. The formula is given below.\n",

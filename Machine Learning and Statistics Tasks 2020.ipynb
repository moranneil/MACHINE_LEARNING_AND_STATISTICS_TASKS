    "prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should\n",

    "From the question above the task involved writing a program to get the square root of the number two without using any of the Python library functions such as math.sqrt. The math.sqrt function can be used to check the answer to the final solution. \n",

    "To get the square root of any number a common method is used to calculate or approximate is the Newton Rampson approximation. This uses a matimatical formula to approximate the square root of a number this formula is run many times or iterations to get the square root approximation.\n",
